   <b>Project Concept:</b> Uber Surge Pricing System with CDC
   </samp>
</h3>
<p>
   <samp>
   Uber's dynamic pricing system works by adjusting ride prices based on real-time supply and demand for drivers in a specific area. For this project, you could simulate how Uber uses CDC to update ride prices when relevant data points like driver availability, traffic conditions, or demand for rides change.
